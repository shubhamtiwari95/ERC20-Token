# About Project

This project aims to create an ERC20 Token using Openzeppelin contracts, compile and deploy using Hardhat and deploy on Goerli Test Network using Infura.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
